## Usage
To seamlessly incorporate the CSS-based sliding menu into your web project, start by including the necessary styles and Font Awesome icons in your HTML file's <head> section. Then, integrate the provided HTML structure within your <body>, ensuring to tailor the content inside the .sidebar_menu div to your project's specifications. Optionally, tweak the CSS styles in the style.css file to align with your project's design preferences. Once completed, open your HTML file in a web browser, where the sliding menu will be activated by clicking the designated icon, offering a user-friendly navigation experience. This straightforward integration allows you to enhance your web application's functionality with a responsive and visually appealing sliding menu.
